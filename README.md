# Project Manager

After learning the basics of React Native w/ Expo, I want to build something useful for myself

### Project Manager

This is an app called Project Manager that will keep track of all my project ideas since my memory is non existent. Whenever idea strikes, just open the app and jot down in a more organize manner. That way, even if i forget about them later, i'll have a record when it's time to bring those ideas to reality
