### Project Manager

This is an app called Project Manager that will keep track of all your project ideas, that would be helpful if you're like me where memory is non existent. Whenever idea strikes, just open the app and jot down in a more organize manner. That way, even if you forget about them later, You'll have a record when it's time to bring those ideas to reality
